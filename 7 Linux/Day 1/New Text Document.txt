kernel : is a piece of software which helps interacting with and controlling hardware


kernel types : 
	monolithic kernel : One large code capable of doing everything thst you require
				-ve : maintaining , managing, updating would be troublesome, restart needed after every change
				+ve : Fast
				
	micro : code provides interface to services, managing , coding done by application and coder.
				-ve : application development and managing became difficult. Speed issues
				+ve : no restart, modularity
	
	hybrid : best of both. Major services and access by kernel but can add new needed module
			Everything after windows 7 is this type. 

			
Syntax : grammar of programming
Semantics : when to use what syntax.
shell does not support fractions. it's from when in ALU arithmetic operationd on factions were not possible.
