What is the Python REPL?
The interactive Python interpreter goes by many names.

Sometimes you'll hear it referred to as the Python prompt, the Python console, or the Python shell, but it's most often called the Python REPL.

REPL is an acronym. It stands for Read, Evaluate, Print, and Loop.

Those four words describe how the REPL works:

It reads what we've typed
Then it evaluates it, meaning it runs the code
Then it prints any value that's returned to it
Then it loops (to step 1), meaning it waits for more input
REPL is just an unofficial term, but it's probably the most commonly used term for the interactive Python interpreter.
