Scenario:

Students are attending classes at a training institute
in Juhu, and they come from different parts of Mumbai:

Virar

Thane

Dombivli

Weâ€™ll record some fictional but realistic commute
times in minutes for students coming from each area.

virar = [90, 95, 100, 110, 105, 100, 98, 102, 107]

	Minimum commute time: 90 minutes

	Maximum commute time: 110 minutes
	
	Median commute time: 100 minutes

Interpretation:

Students from Virar take between 90 and 110 minutes 
to reach Juhu. Most students take around 100 minutes, 
which is the median.


thane = [60, 65, 70, 75, 72, 68, 66, 74, 69]

	Minimum commute time: 60 minutes

	Maximum commute time: 75 minutes

	Median commute time: 69 minutes

Interpretation:

Students from Thane take between 60 and 75 minutes to reach 
Juhu. The median is 69 minutes, meaning most students 
take around that much time. 


dombivli = [70, 75, 78, 80, 76, 74, 72, 79, 77]

	Minimum commute time: 70 minutes

	Maximum commute time: 80 minutes

	Median commute time: 75 minutes

Interpretation:

Students from Dombivli take between 70 and 80 minutes 
to reach Juhu. The median is 75 minutes, meaning most 
students take around that much time to reach Juhu 
from Dombivali.
