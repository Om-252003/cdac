# pip install plotly

"""
Why Plotly opens a browser window?

Ans:- Plotly creates interactive (HTML + JavaScript)
charts, unlike Matplotlib or ggplot which create
static images.

So when you call

fig.show()


Plotly internally:

Saves the figure as a temporary HTML file.

Starts a local web server (something like
http://127.0.0.1:62241/).

Opens that file in your default web browser
for interactivity (zoom, hover, pan, etc.).

if u don't want this then u should save your graph
as a separate html file and later open in whichever
browser you want.

# Create an interactive scatter plot
fig = px.scatter(data, x="Day", y="Sales")
# fig.show()
fig.write_html("e:\\sales_scatter_chart.html")
