# %>%  is called forward pipe operator
# when we do head(iris)
  # only 6 rows will be printed but not stored anywhere
# so we can do demo %>% head() so it means head() is stored in demo
# this results in no confusion when writing complex commands havnig multiple brackets
# demo %>% head() %>% summary()  is like  demo = summary(head(iris))  ; demo

# mutate()  adds new column or modifies current variables in dataset.

# using $ we can just add or modify single column

# mutate() can do for multiple column at once
