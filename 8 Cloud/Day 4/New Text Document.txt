* Cloudwatch - monitors resources and applications
* CloudTrail - Track user activity and API Usage

* IAM important policy : only give permissions that are needed

* redshiftoverwatch: deleted 3rd cluster rifht after it's creation. event is triggered using the cloudwatch events logs.

* EBS - Elastic block service, like S3, but stored in form of files. this is a volume not a service.
* KMS - Key management service in EC2

* RRS - Reduced Redundancy Service.

in s3 every obeject is copied 3 times, in RRS, the object is not stored 3 times, hence durability is also less,chances of loss is expected to be 0.001  means 99.99% only. 

* SNS - Simple Notification Service.

* Alarms in Cloudwatch can be triggered by an event, and notification can be sent. 
whenever the event happens ex. creation of 3rd reshift cluster, the SNS notification is sent to lambda function, and it's code is executed. 

	# topic should be selected, topic is a group of entities which relate to that topic.
	ex. if topic is cloud, then only cloud enigneeers will get the notification not ML users.
	
	subscription of email should be confirmed by the users, services are also added subscriptions ex. lambda service . 
	
	users manually need to confirm to the suubscription but services automatically confirm the subscriptions
	
	select the lambda function that we want. 
	


instance types in ec2 :
 - T (e.g., T2, T3 ... i.e. t3 micro, t2 micro , etc): These are General Purpose, burstable instances. They are ideal for workloads with low-to-moderate CPU usage that experience occasional spikes in activity (e.g., low-traffic websites or development environments).
 
 - M (e.g., M5): These are General Purpose instances that provide a consistent, balanced baseline of resources. They are a good "default choice" for typical backend or enterprise applications where you need an equal proportion of CPU and memory.
 
 - HPC (Hpc family): This is a specific instance category designed for High-Performance Computing workloads that require very high CPU performance and network throughput for large-scale, complex computational tasks like scientific modeling and simulations. 
	
* in ec2, volume 8GB to 30 GB is free. volume means ROM	

* RDS - Relational Database Service
	
	RDS supports 8 database engines 

		- Amazon Aurora

		- MySQL (uses InnoDB as the default storage engine)

		- PostgreSQL

		- MariaDB

		- Oracle

		- Microsoft SQL Server

		Note: Aurora technically has two flavors (Aurora MySQL & Aurora PostgreSQL), but AWS counts them under Aurora.
		
	An EC2 instance includes:

		Component	      |                   Explanation
		Instance Type	  |     Defines CPU (vCPU), memory (RAM), network, and GPU 
		Storage Volume    |   	EBS (Elastic Block Store) — persistent storage
		Instance Store    |	Temporary storage (data lost on stop/terminate)
		(optional)
		
		
	EC2 VM has :
			- instance  : RAM, Processors, GPU
			- Volume (ROM) 
	
	everytime we stopped and opeened ec2, our ip changes because we're getting new servers assigned. hence we have to repeatedly connect the Database with new IPs
	
	elastic ip redirects to correct ip addresses even if connection is stopped and started.

	When you stop and start an EC2 instance:

	Public IP changes (because AWS reassigns networking)

	To keep a static public IP:

	Use Elastic IP

	It maps to your EC2 instance so the IP stays the same even after stop/start
	
	
* VPC : Virtual Private Could (Isolated Cloud Resource)
