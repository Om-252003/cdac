	IP address of device on internet
	32 bits -> 4 octates each contains 8 bits 
	
	classful :
		
		class A : 1st octate is network id, 3 are host ids
		class B : 2 octates are network ids, 2 are host ids
		class C : 3 ocatates are network ids, 1 is host id
		class D : reserved 
		class E : for research purposes.		
		
		host -> devices
		
		
	classless :	
		A smarter way to manage IP addreess.
		we have flexibility to chose the no. of IPs we need.
		
		CIDR : Classless Inter-domain routing
		
		format of CIDR notation : IP_addr/prefix_length
			ex. 192.168.1.0/24
			
			192.168.1.0 -> network addresses
			/24         -> number of bits used for the network part/id. 
			it allows flexible subnetting of the network
			
			ex. 192.48.10.4/24
				network part : 11111111.11111111.11111111
				host part    : 00000000
				
					11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000
					   255     255      255       0
					   
	
	classful vs classless :
	
		classful : 
			fixed network sizes (A,B,C)
			Wastes Ip addresses
		classsless : flexible network sizes
	
	Benefits : 
		
		Efficient way to manage ip addresses
		reduces routing table size ( it has src and dest ip addresses )
		Enables route aggregation
		Simplifies IP management and reduces wastage

AWS Sagemaker : For Cloud ML ( hell lot of expensive )

Athena :  query service
	optimise serverless experience
	charges on runtime of query
	
	athena runs on Trino sql server.
	serverless. 
	can take data from s3 buckets , multicloud architecture and on-premises
	
	Platform as a Service (PaaS): This is the most accurate classification. PaaS provides a platform and tools for developers to build, deploy, and manage applications without the complexity of managing the underlying infrastructure (hardware, operating systems, etc.)
	
	set query output location, that output location must set lifecycle.
	choose catalog if exists. then select the database.
	catalogs have multiple databases.
	create database, table, set input path.
	
	we have to write Schema by ourselves. 
	
	so to counter this we use AWS Glue.
	

AWS Glue : serverless data integration service.

	its the biggest service in AWS, contains so many sub services.
	Glue manages infrastructure. 
	Platform as a Service (PaaS)
	AWS Glue is best described as PaaS because it provides a complete environment for developers and data engineers to build, run, and manage Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL) jobs and data integration pipelines without the burden of managing the underlying infrastructure. 
	You manage: Your data, the logic of your ETL jobs (using Python or Scala scripts), and the configuration of data sources/targets.
	AWS manages: The entire platform, including the servers, storage, networking, operating systems, and the managed Apache Spark environment needed to run the jobs. 
		
	
	Glue edit, clone and monitors ETL jobs
	we can manage resources from background even if Glue is serverless
	
	Crawlers
	A crawler connects to a data store, progresses through a prioritized list of classifiers to determine the schema for your data, and then creates metadata tables in your data catalog.
	
	in short : crawlers can 


	
SQS : Simple Queue Service


HDFS : hadoop distributed file systems

	
	Architecture : 		https://phoenixnap.com/kb/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/hdfs-components-namenode-datanode-datanode.png
	
	Chunking : File dividing into chunks
	
	default size is 128 MB for each chunk in architecture 2nd.
	
	master monitors life of slaves from their heart beat. means response codes (200,404, 500 etc)
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
S3 equivalent in Google : GCS Google cloud storage.
