In this example client and server can be run from two different laptops provided they both are connected to same wifi ( in our case it is "smvita")

decide the laptop from where you are going to run server application. Find out its IPAddress by giving following command on CMD:

ipconfig

when u give above command u will get output like this:


Windows IP Configuration

in the above output
 IPv4 Address. . . . . . . . . . . : 192.168.0.109

192.1680.109  is your IPAddress which u must share with the other laptop who is going to act as a client. Before sharing this ip address just try one more command on your CMD:

ping  192.168.0.109

it should give u following output:


Pinging 192.168.0.109 with 32 bytes of data:
Reply from 192.168.0.109: bytes=32 time<1ms TTL=128

Ping statistics for 192.168.0.109:
    Packets: Sent = 4, Received = 4, Lost = 0 (0% loss),
Approximate round trip times in milli-seconds:
    Minimum = 0ms, Maximum = 0ms, Average = 0ms


That means everything is fine, one who is connected to same wifi can connect to your laptop easily. For that u have to share your IPAddress 192.168.0.109 with the other person.


Since u r going to act as a server, run following python code (Server.py) on your PyCharm:


import socket

host = "0.0.0.0"  # listen on all interfaces
port = 12345

s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
s.bind((host, port))
s.listen(1)
print("Server listening...")

conn, addr = s.accept()
print("Connected by:", addr)

while True:
    data = conn.recv(1024)
    if not data:
        break
    print("Client:", data.decode())
    msg = input("Server reply: ")
    conn.send(msg.encode())

conn.close()


make sure it works and give a message "Server listening ..."


go to other laptop and inside the PyCharm type following code (Client.py):


import socket

host = 192.168.0.109 # replace with server's IP
port = 12345

s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
s.connect((host, port))

while True:
    msg = input("Client message: ")
    s.send(msg.encode())
    data = s.recv(1024)
    print("Server:", data.decode())



run this program  and make it connects to the other laptop and thereby the entire socket programming application works smoothly.
