1) Write a Python program to count the elements in a list until an element is a tuple.

Sample input : list = [10, 20, 30, (40,50), 60]
Sample output = 3

list1 = [10, 20, 30, (40,50), 60]
sum=0
for i in list1 :
    if type(i) == tuple:
        break
    sum+=1
print(sum)
   
2) create a tuple to store 5 numbers and then sort it in ascending and descending order.
numbers = (15, 8, 22, 3, 10)
numbers_list = list(numbers)
numbers_list.sort()
print("Sorted in ascending order:", numbers_list)
numbers_list.sort(reverse=True)
print("Sorted in descending order:", numbers_list)


3) Write a Python program to find the repeated items of a tuple.
my_tuple = (2, 4, 6, 2, 8, 4, 10, 2)
repeated_items = []
for item in my_tuple:
    if my_tuple.count(item) > 1 and item not in repeated_items:
        repeated_items.append(item)
print("Repeated items in the tuple:", repeated_items)
