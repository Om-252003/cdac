"""
Why Plotly opens a browser window?

Ans:- Plotly creates interactive (HTML + JavaScript)
charts, unlike Matplotlib or ggplot which create
static images.

So when you call

fig.show()


Plotly internally:

Saves the figure as a temporary HTML file.

Starts a local web server (something like
http://127.0.0.1:62241/).

Opens that file in your default web browser
for interactivity (zoom, hover, pan, etc.).

if u don't want this then u should save your graph
as a separate html file and later open in whichever
browser you want.

fig = px.bar(df, x="Category", y="Value", color="Category", title="Category Comparison")
color tells Plotly to assign different colors to bars based on a column.

Here, the column is "Category", which has values "A", "B", "C", "D".

	 What happens in the output
Each bar gets a different color according to its category.

Plotly automatically creates a legend showing which color corresponds to which category.

This makes it easier to distinguish bars visually.

Without color="Category":

All bars would appear in the same default color, and it would be harder to differentiate categories.
