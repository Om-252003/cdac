ggplot style

You describe what the plot should show, not step-by-step instructions.

The idea comes from the Grammar of Graphics (GoG):

Data → your DataFrame

Aesthetics (aes) → mapping of variables to axes (x=Hours, y=Money)

Geometry (geom_line) → type of plot (line, bar, scatter, etc.)

Labels (labs) → title, x-axis, y-axis

So you’re saying “Plot Money Earned vs Hours as a line graph” → and ggplot builds it.
This is a declarative approach → you describe the WHAT.

Definition of Grammar of Graphics

Grammar of Graphics is a framework for building plots by combining independent building blocks:

Data

Aesthetics (mapping data to axes, color, size)

Geometries (how data is displayed: line, bar, scatter)

Scales, Facets, Labels, etc.

It’s like constructing a sentence in grammar: subject + verb + object.
In ggplot → data + aes + geom.

    "Hours Worked": range(1, 11),
    "Money Earned": [200 * i for i in range(1, 11)]

    ggplot(df, aes(x="Hours Worked", y="Money Earned"))
    + geom_line()
    + labs(
        title="Hours Worked vs Money Earned",
        x="Hours Worked",
        y="Money Earned (₹)"
    )
)

# Display the plot
plot.show()   # <-- this works in PyCharm / scripts
