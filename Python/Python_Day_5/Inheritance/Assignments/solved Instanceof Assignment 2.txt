				Animal

					void makeSound()
					
override "makeSound()" in all the child classes.

		Dog		Cat		Tiger
							void hunting()



define perform function.

	perform function should be defined in such a way that it can accept any animal and invoke "makeSound()" function.

	also make sure if "Tiger" is passed , its "hunting()" method also should be called.
	
Answer:
class Animal:
    def makeSound(self):
        print("Animal makes sound")

class Dog(Animal):
    def makeSound(self):
        print("Bark")

class Cat(Animal):
    def makeSound(self):
        print("meow")

class Tiger(Animal):
    def makeSound(self):
        print("Roar")
    def hunting(self):
        print("Tiger is hunting")

def perform(a):
    if isinstance(a,Tiger):
        a.hunting()
    a.makeSound()

perform(Dog())
perform(Cat())
perform(Tiger())
