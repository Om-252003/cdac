There are two files required for this
exercise. They are called custs and txns1.txt. custs file contains customer
information in a comma separated file. The individual columns represent


Customer ID, First Name, Last Name, Age,
Profession


The transaction data is present in the file
txns1.txt. This contains transactions which happened in a Sports retail store.
The columns represent


TransactionID, Date, Customer No, Amount,
Category, Item, City, State, Transaction Type.


Given these two set of data find out the
total amount spent by each age group in the store.  You may classify the age group of the
customers into three.


Customers with age less than 30


Customers with age between 30 and 50


Customers with age higher than 50


You may use a managed table to solve this
problem.


Now, create a table where the data is
partitioned by Category and bucketed by TransactionID(into 4 buckets)


Insert the data into this table and
validate the same
