suppose u have declared following serial version uid in the class

private static final long serialVersionUID = 1000;


now after compiling (assume A.java) if you apply

serialver A

you will get the following output


private static final long serialVersionUID = 1000L;

Most Imp:

Inside the class if you manipulate access modifier (say if you make it public), compile the file and apply 

	serialver A

ouput will be still:

private static final long serialVersionUID = 1000L;


however if u try to manipulate other modifiers including "static","final","long" or even a name i.e. serialVersionUID , JVM generates its own serial version uid.
