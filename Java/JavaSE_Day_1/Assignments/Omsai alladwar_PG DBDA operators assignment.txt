`1) accept two numbers and add them.

int a = 10;
int b = 20;
int c = a+b;

System.out.println("a+b"+(a+b));


2) accept two numbers and subtract them.
int a = 10;
int b = 20;
int c = a-b;

System.out.println("a-b"+(a-b));

3) accept two numbers and multiply them.
int a = 10;
int b = 20;
int c = ab;

System.out.println("a*b"+(ab));

4) accept two numbers and devide them.
int a = 10;
int b = 20;
int c = a/b;

System.out.println("a/b"+(a/b));

5) accept two numbers and check whether first number is greater or second number is greater or they are equal.

int a = 10;
int b = 20;
int c = a+b;

if (a>b)
{
	System.out.println("a is greater");
}
else if(b>a)
{
	System.out.println("b is greater");
}
else if(a==b)
{
	System.out.println("both are equal");
}


6) accept a number and check whether it is divisible by 3 or not.
int a = 30;
if(a%3 == 0)
{
	System.out.println(" number is divisible by 3");
}
