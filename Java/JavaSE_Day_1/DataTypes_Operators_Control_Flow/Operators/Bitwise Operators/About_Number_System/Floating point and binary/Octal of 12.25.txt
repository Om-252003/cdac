12.25

how will you find out the octal of above number

12 is integer part and .25 is a fractional part.
The rule is 
for integer part , you've to devide integer part ( 12 ) by 8 till you get quotient as 0 and then consider all the remainders in a "reverse order".
for a fractional part, you've to multiply by 8 till you get result as 0 and then consider "the straight order or same order".


       12
8	1  4
8       0  1

reverse order

0 1 4 


.25

.25 * 8

	2.00
	

you have to stop here as after a dot ( . ) , there are zeros

so if you check integer part here (look at the left side of dot), it is
	2

already we've calculated octal of 12
	1 4.2
