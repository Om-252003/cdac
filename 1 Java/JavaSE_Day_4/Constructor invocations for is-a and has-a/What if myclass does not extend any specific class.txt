e.g.

public class myclass 
{
    static {
        System.out.println("in myclass static");
    }

    public static void main(String args[]) {
    }
}


When you run by giving the command:

		java myclass


JVM loads myclass directly (no parent user-defined class here).

Note: Every class in Java implicitly extends "Object" (if no extends is written).

But "Object" is part of the core JDK, and itâ€™s already loaded by the "bootstrap classloader", so its static blocks (if any) would already be initialized long before.

In fact, "Object" has no static block.

So the only static block that runs is from myclass
