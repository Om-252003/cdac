12.25

how will you find out the Hexa-decimal of above number

12 is integer part and .25 is a fractional part.
The rule is 
for integer part , you've to devide integer part ( 12 ) by 16 till you get quotient as 0 and then consider all the remainders in a "reverse order".

for a fractional part, you've to multiply by 16 till you get result as 0 and then consider "the straight order or same order".


       12
16	0  12

reverse order

0 12

i.e.

12

i.e.

C   [ i.e.  10 is A , 11 is B  and so on.... ]


.25

.25 * 16

	4.00
	

you have to stop here as after a dot ( . ) , there are zeros

so if you check integer part here (look at the left side of dot), it is
	4
