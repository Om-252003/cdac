public class First implements Serializable
{
private static final long serialVersionUID = 1000;
	String name="sachin";
	int age=20;
}

compile "First.java"

now give following command:

serialver First

you will get the following output:

First:    private static final long serialVersionUID = 1000L;

It proves when you explicitly declare serial version uid in the class, JVM uses the same and does not generate it.
