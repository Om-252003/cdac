For application-level enums (loaded by the system/application class loader), the class loader lives until the JVM shuts down.

So, those enums are GC’ed only when the JVM exits.

Normal objects → can be GC’ed once all references are gone.

Enum constants → are special singletons tied to their class.

They live as long as their enum class is loaded.

In a normal application, that means they are only garbage collected when the JVM shuts down.
